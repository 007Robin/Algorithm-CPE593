2. With isolated I/O there is a single address space for memory locations and I/O devices.
With memory mapped I/O, there is a single address space for memory locations and I/O drives. With isolated I/Ok, the address space for I/O is isolated from that from memory, since the bus may be equipped with memory read and right plus input and output command lines.

3. The difference between virtual circuits and packet switching
the path of each packet

4. With a daisy chain the processor just picks the interrupt line with the highest priority.
False

5. 
 There are 1,100 (sectors) * 40,000 (cylinders)*6 (surfaces) = 264,000,000 blocks on this disk. Thus, the total storage capacity of this disk is 264M *0.5KB = 132GB.
 
 6. How many connections are required for 60 nodes to be connected in a full mesh topology
 Node(node-1)/2=1770

 9. The advantage of clustering is
 
 Clustering servers is completely a scalable solution. You can add resources to the cluster afterwards.
 If a server in the cluster needs any maintenance, you can do it by stopping it while handing the load over to other servers.
 Among high availability options, clustering takes a special place since it is reliable and easy to configure. In case of a server is having a problem providing the services furthermore, other servers in the cluster can take the load.
